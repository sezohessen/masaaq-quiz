This is a multi-tenancy project developed by Masaaq company to manage quizzes. The project uses a single database to handle multiple tenants. we use the [tenancyforlaravel](https://tenancyforlaravel.com/) package.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:sezohessen/masaaq-quiz.git quiz

6. You can access you central domain by visiting : `http://localhost:8000` and tenant domain (created by seeder) by visiting `http://test.localhost:8000` (this is changed depend on you env `APP_URL`) if you want to change central domain do not forget to change env `CENTRAL_DOMAIN`

    > Note: You can change the number of `attempts_records` (20 by default) before running the seeders (in the `config/application.php` file) so you can downloading 20k CSV files.
